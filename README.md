# Valkry

This repository contains the CAD (SolidWorks) files for **Valkry**, a terrain-traversing rover currently under development.  
> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is **still in its design phase**. The mechanical structure, components, and functionality are being iteratively improved.

---

##  Project Description

**Valkry** is designed to navigate rough and uneven terrain and optionally perform tasks like excavation using a robotic arm or excavator-like attachment.

---

## ⚙️ Design Constraints

-  **Articulated suspension** for maximizing obstacle clearance and terrain adaptability  
-   Designed using **commonly available materials** to ensure ease of manufacturing and cost-effectiveness  
-  Includes **structural analysis** (stress/strain simulations) for select components  
-  **Dimensional constraints:** 1.5 × 0.7 × 1 m³ (L × W × H)

---

##  Features

-  **Rocker-bogie mechanism** for passive obstacle negotiation  
-  **Under-chassis differential bar** to maintain stability between arms  
-  **4-servo turning** system for a reduced turning radius and better maneuverability  
-  **6 DC motors** to power the wheels individually
